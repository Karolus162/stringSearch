Task #2
Search for text occurrences is implemented in [Occurrence.kt](src/main/kotlin/Occurrence.kt) and tests are implemented in [SearcherTest.kt](src/test/kotlin/SearcherTest.kt).

In my solution I made it so the searcher is able to look for strings that are longer than one line. It's also subject of tests.
